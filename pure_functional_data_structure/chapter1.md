## Chapter I Purely Functional Data Structure

### Strict vs Lazy

    In strict languages, the arguments to a function are evaluated before
    the body of the functionl. In lazy languages,arguments are evaluated
    in demand-drive fashio;they are initally passed in unevaluated form and
    are evaluted only when the computation need the results to continue.
    
    Once a given argument is evaluated, the value of that argument is 
    cached is known as *memoization*
    
    
### Terminology

    An abstract data type (type and collection of function on that type)
    
    A concrete realization of an abstract data type.Refer as an *implementation*
    
    A instance of a data typpe such a particular list or tree.Object or a version
    
    Unique identity that is invariant under updates.
