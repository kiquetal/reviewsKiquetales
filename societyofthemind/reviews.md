### The mind and the Brain


#### 1.5 Common sense

 *It was never supoosed[the poet Imlac said] that cogitation is inherent in matter,
 or that every particle is a thinking being. Yet if any part of matter be devoid of thought,
 what part can we suppose to think? Matter can differ from matter only in form,bulk,density,
 motionand direction of motion: to which of these, however varied or combined, can consciousness
 be annexed?To be round or square,to be solid or fluid, to be great or little, to be moved
 slowly or swiftly one way or another, are modes of material existence, all equally alien from the
 nature of cogitation If matter be once without thought, it can only be made to think by some
 new modification, but all the modifications which it can admit are equally unconnected with
 cogitative powers* [Samuel Johnson]
 
 *You cannot think about thinking, without thinking about thinking about something* [Seymour Papert]
 
 If common sense is so diverse and intricate, what makes it seem so obvious and natural? This
 illusion of simplicity comes from losing touch with what happened during infancy, when we formed
 our fist abilities. As each new group of skill matures, we build more layers on top of them.
 As time goes on, the layers below become increasingly remote until, when we try to speak of 
 them in later life, we find ourselves with little more to say than 'I don't know'.
 
#### 1.6 Agent and agencies

It is not enough to explain only what each separate agent does. We must also understand how those
part are interrelated--that is , how groups of agents can accomplish things.
Knowing how is not the same as knowing why. In this book, we'll always be switching between angest
and agencies because, depending on our purposes, we'll have to use different viewpoints and kind
of descriptions.

## Chapter II

*It is the nature of the mind that makes individuals kin, and the differences in the shape, form
or manner of the material atoms out of whose intricate relationships that mind is built are 
altogether trivial* [Issac Asimov]

#### 2.1 Components and connections

First we mut know how each separate part works,second we must know each part interacts with those
to which it is connected. And third, we have to understand how all these local interactions combine
to accomplish what that system does--as seen from the outside.


#### 2.2 Novelist and reductionist

*Reductionist* those people who prefer to build on old ideas.
*Novelist* the ones who like to champion new hypotheses.

    Reudctionist are usually right at least at science's cautous core, where novelties rarely
    survive for long. Outside that realm, though, novelist reign, since older ideas have had 
    more time toshow their flaws.
    
#### 2.3 Parts and wholes

We're often told that certain wholes are *more than the sum of the parts.*.We hear this expressed
with reverent words like 'holistic' and 'gestalt', whose academmic tone suggest that they refer
to clear and definite ideas. But I suspect the actual function of such terms is to anesthesize
a sense of ignorance. We say 'gestalt' when things combine to act in way we can't explain, 
'holistic' when we're caught off guard bly unexpected happening and realize we understand less
than we thought we did. 

It's harmful, though when naming leads the mind to think that names alone bring meaning close.
