Chapter2 Cognitie Friction

qMost software is designed by accident.
Tradition is the strongest influence in the design of all of these media. The biggest difference is that the builder-designer of the hut will also be its  primary occupant, whereas programmers typically don't use the software they design.

Interaction versus Interface Design
The consequence of isolating design at the interface level is that it licenses programmers to reason like "I can code as I please because an 'interface' will be slapped on after I'm done'.It pospone design until after programming, when it is too late.

Interaction designers, think first conceptually, then in terms of behavior, and last in term of interface.
